# Filing Options and Agencies

Use this as a checklist to decide where to file and in what order. Deadlines vary—check each site before filing.

## Courts
- County District Court (General civil or housing docket): Full remedies, more formal.
- Conciliation/Small Claims Court: Faster/cheaper; monetary limits apply.
- Housing Court (if available in your county): Specialized landlord-tenant issues.

## Government Agencies (depending on facts)
- State Attorney General – Consumer Protection: For unfair or deceptive practices.
- City/County Code Enforcement or Housing Authority: For unsafe living conditions or local code issues.
- State Human Rights Department: For discrimination complaints (strict deadlines).
- HUD (housing discrimination, federally funded housing issues).
- CFPB (financial consumer issues, if any paperwork/financing overlapped).

## Alternative / Pressure Channels
- BBB or private mediation: Non-binding but may help settlement.
- Legal Aid / Tenant Advocacy: Advice or representation if eligible.

Tip: Prioritize venues with strict deadlines first (many administrative complaints have short windows—often 180 days for some discrimination claims). Keep copies of everything in `08_Filings_and_Service/filing_receipts/` and track actions in `08_Filings_and_Service/service_log.md`.
