# Hearing Prep Checklist

- Elements proven for each claim (map to exhibits)
- Print exhibit set + index; label clearly (A, B, C…)
- Opening statement outline (2–3 minutes)
- Key questions for opposing party/witness
- Anticipate defenses (e.g., “as-is”); rebuttal points
- Bring originals + copies (3 sets: you, court, other side)
- Logistics (arrival time, parking, courtroom number)
