- Overpaid rent (if unit uninhabitable)
- Cost of repairs you paid for
- Property damage
- Moving expenses
- Storage costs
- Temporary housing costs
- Lost wages
- Medical bills

**Formula for Reduced Rent Due to Uninhabitability**:
```
Monthly Rent × (% Uninhabitable) × Number of Months = Damages

Example: $1,000/mo × 50% uninhabitable × 6 months = $3,000
```

**Security Deposit**:
```
Deposit Paid - Proper Deductions + Penalties = Amount Owed

Example: $1,200 - $0 + $1,200 (statutory penalty) = $2,400
```

**Statutory Penalties** (Check specific statutes):
- Security deposit violations: May get deposit × 2
- Retaliation: Statutory damages possible
- Unlawful lockout: Multiple of actual damages
