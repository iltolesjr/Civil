## Understanding Lawyer Involvement

### Scenarios Where Lawyers May Be Involved

1. **You hire a lawyer** to represent you
2. **The defendant hires a lawyer** to defend against your claims
3. **Both parties have lawyers** (formal litigation)
4. **Free legal services** (legal aid, pro bono)
5. **Consultation only** (you still represent yourself)

### Why Lawyer Involvement Changes Things

- **More formal procedures** - Strict rules of evidence and procedure
- **Increased complexity** - Legal strategies and motions
- **Higher stakes** - Professional representation means stronger opposition
- **Better preparation needed** - You must be more organized and thorough
- **Discovery process** - Formal exchange of evidence and information
- **Settlement negotiations** - Professional negotiators involved
