## Need Help?

### If You're Not Sure Where to Put Something

**Ask yourself**:
1. Is it a photo of physical conditions? → `evidence/`
2. Is it communication (text, email, call)? → `correspondence/`
3. Is it an official document or form? → `legal_documents/`
4. Is it research or legal info? → `research/`

### Still Not Sure?
Put it in `evidence/` and note it in the Evidence Tracking Template - you can reorganize later.
