4. **What it shows** (describe accurately)
5. **It hasn't been altered** (no editing except cropping if necessary)
6. **It fairly and accurately represents** what you saw
7. **Why it's relevant** to your case

### Sample Court Testimony for Photos

"Your Honor, I'd like to introduce Exhibit A."

**Judge**: "What is it?"

**You**: "This is a photograph I took on [date] at approximately [time] at [location]. It shows [describe]. I took it with my cell phone. The photo has not been edited or altered in any way. It fairly and accurately represents the condition I saw on that date."

**Judge**: "Any objection?"

**Other party**: "No objection" / "[States objection]"

**Judge**: "Exhibit A is admitted" / "Sustained/Overruled"

## Appendix: Minnesota Evidence Rules for Photos

**Photos are generally admissible if**:
- Relevant to the case
- Authentic (really shows what you claim)
- Not prejudicial (shocking photos may be excluded if probative value is outweighed)
- Properly authenticated by witness testimony

**Common objections**:
- "Lacks foundation" - You haven't shown who took it or when
- "Not authenticated" - Can't prove it shows what you claim
- "Irrelevant" - Doesn't relate to issues in case
- "Unfair prejudice" - Too shocking or inflammatory

**Your response**:
- Testify to the foundation (you took it, when, where)
- Explain what it shows
- Explain why it's relevant
- Show it's necessary to prove your case
