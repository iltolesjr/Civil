## 💡 CRAFTING YOUR STRONGEST ARGUMENTS

### The IRAC Method (Legal Reasoning)
Use this structure for each argument:

**I = ISSUE**  
What legal question needs to be decided?  
*Example: "Did defendant breach the lease agreement?"*

**R = RULE**  
What law applies to this issue?  
*Example: "Under Minnesota Statute §504B.171, a landlord must..."*

**A = APPLICATION**  
How do the facts of your case fit the law?  
*Example: "Here, the defendant failed to provide the required notice because..."*

**C = CONCLUSION**  
What should the judge decide?  
*Example: "Therefore, defendant breached the lease and owes plaintiff damages."*

### Power Words and Phrases
✅ "The evidence clearly shows..."  
✅ "The law requires..."  
✅ "Defendant failed to..."  
✅ "As shown in Exhibit [#]..."  
✅ "Minnesota courts have held..."  
✅ "The facts demonstrate..."  

❌ Avoid: "I think," "I believe," "Maybe," "Probably"  
✓ Use: "The evidence proves," "The law states," "The facts show"

## 📊 EVIDENCE MANAGEMENT

### The 5 Rules of Evidence
1. **Relevant** - Does it relate to your claim?
2. **Authentic** - Can you prove it's real?
3. **Organized** - Number and label everything
4. **Explained** - Tell the judge what each piece proves
5. **Clean copies** - Readable, complete, professional

### Evidence Presentation Order
Present evidence in this strategic order:

1. **Foundation documents** (lease, contract, agreement)
2. **Performance/compliance** (you did what you were supposed to)
3. **Breach/violation** (they didn't do what they should)
4. **Notice/attempt to resolve** (you tried to fix it)
5. **Damages** (what it cost you)
6. **Supporting communications** (their admissions, excuses)

### Creating an Exhibit List
```
EXHIBIT A: Lease Agreement dated [date]
EXHIBIT B: Payment receipt for security deposit dated [date]
EXHIBIT C: Written notice to landlord dated [date]
EXHIBIT D: Photographs of property condition taken [date]
EXHIBIT E: Text message exchange dated [date]
EXHIBIT F: Email correspondence dated [date]
EXHIBIT G: Receipt for moving expenses dated [date]
[Continue numbering sequentially]
```

**Make 3 copies of everything:**
- 1 for the judge
- 1 for the defendant
- 1 for yourself

---

## 🎯 DAMAGES CALCULATION

### Types of Damages You Can Seek

#### Economic Damages (Out-of-Pocket Losses)
Must be proven with documentation:
- Security deposit wrongfully withheld
- Cost to repair/replace damaged property
- Moving and storage expenses
- Lost rent or additional housing costs
- Utility deposits and setup fees
- Any other provable financial loss

#### Statutory Damages
Some Minnesota laws provide for specific damages:
- Security deposit violations: up to 2x the deposit
- Unfair business practices: statutory amounts
- Attorney fees (if lease/statute allows)

#### Pre-Judgment Interest
- Minnesota law allows interest on amounts owed
- Usually from date of breach or demand
- Calculate at statutory rate

**Always:**
- Keep receipts for everything
- Document all expenses
- Create a detailed spreadsheet
- Be prepared to explain each amount

## 🛡️ ANTICIPATING DEFENSES

### Common Defenses & How to Counter Them

**Defense: "Plaintiff caused the damage"**
- Counter: Photographs showing condition at move-in
- Counter: Move-in inspection report
- Counter: Normal wear and tear vs. damage

**Defense: "Plaintiff didn't follow procedures"**
- Counter: Certified mail receipts showing notice
- Counter: Text/email proof of communication
- Counter: Documentation of all attempts to resolve

**Defense: "Plaintiff owes money to defendant"**
- Counter: Payment records showing full payment
- Counter: Bank statements
- Counter: Receipts and canceled checks

**Defense: "It's a he-said/she-said situation"**
- Counter: This is why documentation is crucial
- Counter: Written communications are evidence
- Counter: Consistency of your story vs. theirs

### Handling Surprise Evidence
If defendant produces unexpected evidence:
1. Stay calm - don't react emotionally
2. Ask to review it carefully
3. Point out if it's inconsistent with their previous statements
4. If needed, ask judge for time to respond
5. Don't accept fabricated or altered documents
