**Getting the Facts:**

## III. THREE ESSENTIAL OBJECTIONS FOR PRO SE LITIGANTS

### 1. HEARSAY OBJECTION

**What It Is:** Out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted

**When to Object:** 
- Witness testifying about what someone else said
- Document containing someone's statement being offered for its truth
- "He told me that..." or "She said that..."

**How to Object:** 
- Stand and say: **"Objection, hearsay."**

**Common Exceptions (when hearsay IS allowed):**
- Party admissions (statements by the opposing party)
- Excited utterances
- Present sense impressions
- Statements for medical diagnosis
- Business records (with proper foundation)

**Examples to Watch For:**
- ❌ "My friend told me the defendant was there" (hearsay)
- ✅ "I saw the defendant there" (personal knowledge, not hearsay)

**Hearsay Situations in Your Case:**
- **Potential Issue:** [Describe potential hearsay issue]
- **Your Response:** [How you'll object or lay foundation]

### 2. NONRESPONSIVE OBJECTION

**What It Is:** Witness answers a different question than what was asked

**When to Object:**
- Witness gives information beyond the scope of the question
- Witness volunteers extra information
- Witness tries to explain instead of answering yes/no

**How to Object:**
- Say: **"Objection, nonresponsive. Move to strike."**

**Example:**
- Question: "What time did you arrive?"
- Bad Answer: "Well, I left home at 5:00 because traffic was bad, and I had to stop for gas, so I got there around 6:00, but normally it only takes 30 minutes..."
- Good Answer: "6:00 PM."

**When It Helps You:**
- On cross-examination when hostile witness tries to explain
- When witness is avoiding your question

### 3. SPECULATION / LACK OF PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OBJECTION

**What It Is:** 
- **Speculation:** Witness is guessing or assuming facts
- **Lack of Personal Knowledge:** Witness didn't see/hear it themselves

**When to Object:**
- Witness uses words like "I think," "I believe," "probably," "maybe"
- Witness testifies about something they didn't personally observe
- Witness offers opinions (unless they're an expert)

**How to Object:**
- Say: **"Objection, speculation."** OR
- Say: **"Objection, lack of personal knowledge."**

**Examples:**
- ❌ "I think he was angry" (speculation - unless witness saw/heard anger)
- ✅ "He was yelling and his face was red" (personal observation)
- ❌ "The document was forged" (opinion without expertise)
- ✅ "This is not my signature" (personal knowledge)

**Your Anticipated Objections:**
- [ ] [Situation where you might need to object]
- [ ] [Situation where you might need to object]
