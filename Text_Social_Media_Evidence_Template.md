## I. PROOF NEEDED TO USE TEXTS, EMAILS, & SOCIAL MEDIA IN COURT

### The Two-Part Test for Admissibility

To use text messages, emails, or social media posts as evidence, you must prove:

1. **AUTHENTICITY** - The message is genuine and what you claim it to be
   - It's a real message, not fabricated
   - It hasn't been altered or manipulated
   - It accurately represents the actual communication

2. **AUTHORSHIP** - The message was sent/created by the person you claim sent it
   - You can identify who sent/posted it
   - You have evidence linking the sender to the message
   - The content is consistent with the purported author

**Without proving both authenticity AND authorship, your evidence will likely be excluded.**

## II. WHAT ARE "AUTHENTIC" TEXTS, EMAILS, & SOCIAL MEDIA?

### Definition of Authenticity
Authentic evidence is evidence that is what you claim it to be - it's genuine, unaltered, and accurately represents the actual communication.

### How to Prove Authenticity

**For Text Messages:**
- [ ] Screenshot shows phone number
- [ ] Screenshot shows date and time stamps
- [ ] Screenshots are in chronological order
- [ ] Metadata is preserved (if possible)
- [ ] No signs of editing or alteration
- [ ] Complete conversation (not selective excerpts that mislead)

**For Emails:**
- [ ] Header information visible (From, To, Date, Subject)
- [ ] Email addresses are shown
- [ ] Timestamp is visible
- [ ] Full email chain included (not just excerpts)
- [ ] Attachments referenced are preserved
- [ ] No alterations to content

**For Social Media Posts:**
- [ ] Platform is identifiable (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc.)
- [ ] Profile/account name is visible
- [ ] Date and time of post shown
- [ ] URL or post link documented
- [ ] Screenshots include enough context (profile picture, bio, etc.)
- [ ] Comments/reactions preserved if relevant
- [ ] No cropping that changes meaning

### Red Flags That Hurt Authenticity
- Blurry screenshots
- Missing timestamps
- Inconsistent formatting
- Evidence of editing software use
- Gaps in message sequences
- Different fonts or colors
- Partial conversations without context

**Your Authentication Checklist:**
- [ ] All screenshots are clear and legible

### How to Prove Authorship

#### Direct Evidence of Authorship:

**Phone Number Identification:**
- [ ] You recognize the phone number as belonging to the other party

**Email Address Identification:**
- [ ] You recognize the email address
- [ ] You've previously communicated with this address
- [ ] The email signature identifies the sender
- [ ] The address matches their business/personal domain

**Social Media Account Identification:**
- [ ] Account name matches the person's real name
- [ ] Profile picture shows the person
- [ ] Account contains biographical information matching the person
- [ ] The account has been used to communicate with you before
- [ ] Friends/followers list includes mutual connections
- [ ] Posts reference information only that person would know

#### Circumstantial Evidence of Authorship:

**Content-Based Evidence:**
- Message refers to facts only the sender would know

"I recognize this phone number, [###-###-####], as belonging to [Name]. 
I have been communicating with [Name] at this number since [date]. 
The content of these messages refers to [specific facts only they would know]. 
Based on my familiarity with [Name]'s communication style and the content 
of the messages, I can identify these as messages sent by [Name]."
```

**For Social Media:**
```
"This is a screenshot from [Name]'s Facebook profile. I know this is their 
profile because: (1) it displays their name and photograph, (2) I am friends 
with this account, (3) I have communicated with [Name] through this account 
before, and (4) the profile contains biographical information consistent with 
[Name]'s background."
```
